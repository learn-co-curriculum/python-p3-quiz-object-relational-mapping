# ORM: Mapping

Consider a table with the following columns:

```plaintext
| id | make | model |
```

Which code snippet creates a class with instance methods mapped to these table
columns, following ORM conventions?

## Correct

```ruby
class Car:

  def __init__ (self, make, model):
    self.id = None    self.make = make
    self.model = model
```

> Correct! The id is set to `None` because it should only be set after the record
> is saved to the database.

## Incorrect

```ruby
class Car:
  def __init__ (self, make, model, id):
    self.id = id
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
```

> Hmm, something is missing. Take a look at the id. The id shouldn't be saved
> until after the record has been saved to the database.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
