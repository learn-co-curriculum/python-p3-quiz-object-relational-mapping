# Question 5

What are the steps needed to write a class that is mapped to a database table?
Select **all** that apply.

## Correct

Create a table with the same name as the class, but pluralized

> Exactly! If the class is called Cat, the table should be called cats.

## Correct

Match the names of the table's columns to the attributes&nbsp;of the class

> So true! We need the columns and attributes to match, so that we know which data
> we're manipulating.

## Incorrect

Match the names of the table's columns to class variables

> Not quite. Remember that each row in the table is represented by an object, or
> an instance of a class. What might that mean?

## Incorrect

Create a table with the exact same name as the class

> Not quite. The table name and class name should be similar, but not exactly the
> same.

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
