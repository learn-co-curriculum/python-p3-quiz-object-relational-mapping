# ORM: Mapping

Consider the following code:

```python
class Car:
  def __init__ (self, make, model):
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
```

In order to "map" this `Car` class to a `cars` database table, what needs to be
done first?

## Correct

Create a database

> Yes! We can't map the class to anything if there's no database.

## Incorrect

Create a `cars` table

> We actually need something else first. What stores tables?

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
