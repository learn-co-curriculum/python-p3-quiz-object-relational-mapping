# ORM: Mapping

Why do we use a dedicated method `save()` to insert a row into a table instead
of saving the record in ` __init__ `?

## Correct

We don't want to couple the creation of objects with saving records to a
database

> Yes! This makes our code more modular, so we can choose to create objects or
> save to the database. This is much more flexible than coupling both functions in
> the same method.

## Correct

We might need to create objects without saving them to the database

> Exactly! We may need to manipulate those objects after certain tasks have run,
> and then save them.

## Incorrect

We can't set the attributes and save the record in the same method

> Not quite. We can do both of these things in a method if we want.

## Incorrect

There's no real reason. It's just a convention

> We do have reasons, though this is a convention.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
