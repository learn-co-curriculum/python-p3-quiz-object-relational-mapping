# ORM: Basics

To follow a pattern of _logical design_, if we have a `Car` Python class, what
should the corresponding SQL table be named?

## Correct

`cars`

> Perfect! The table holds many cars, so it makes sense to call it cars.

## Incorrect

`car`

> Not quite. Does the table hold one car or many?

## Incorrect

`vehicle`

> Not quite. Conventionally, our table names and class names use matching
> terminology, except one is singular and the other is plural.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
